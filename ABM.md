Agent based Models (ABM) is commonly regarded as one of the most popular modelling techniques in the social and ecological sciences.

ABMs are generally iterative models which essentially means that they are controlled by repeated processes until they stop by reaching a condition. There are generally two types of stopping conditions for ABMs;
