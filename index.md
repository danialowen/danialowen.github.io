Hi, my name is Danial Owen; a PhD student at the University of Liverpool. I am a student in the ESRC's Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT), in the process of being trained in Data Analytics and Society in conjunction with three other univerisites; 

- University of Leeds 
- University of Manchester 
- University of Sheffield

I am lucky to work alongside many, very talented individuals at the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool. My research in particular, aims to explore new possibilities and enhance the understanding of new urban sensors and their use in Smart Cities. The research enatils the exploration of these new urban sensors on existing projects in Spain, and aims to expand any new learnings, worldwide. The research includes analysis and interpretation of Big Data, generously collected and provided by my sponsor company, IDOM.
