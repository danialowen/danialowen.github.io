## About Me

Hi, my name is Danial Owen; a PhD student at the University of Liverpool. I am a Physical Geography graduate at the University of Liverpool, and originally from a relatively small, seaside town in North Wales, called Harlech. Now, I am a student in the ESRC's Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT), in the process of being trained in [Data Analytics and Society](https://datacdt.org/) in conjunction with three other univerisites; University of Leeds, University of Manchester and University of Sheffield.

I am lucky to work alongside many talented individuals at the University of Liverpool's [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/about/). My PhD research, aims to explore the new possibilities and enhance the understanding of new urban sensors in Smart Cities. My work will focus on the research of urban sensors on two existing projects in Spain (Costa Del Sol and Valencia) with the hope of being able to create a universal model, useable in not only Spain, but cities worldwide. The research includes analysis and interpretation of Big Data, generously collected and provided by my sponsor company, IDOM.  

## My Work

This website will provide the links to some of my work completed during my academic research. Within each link there will be a brief description of the work and a link to the code (most likely on [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/danialowen)). Feel free to contact me with any suggestions or questions regarding any of my projects by emailing me on: *d.w.owen@liverpool.ac.uk*

### Agent Based Model 

Here is the the link to the page on my fist project; my [Agent Based Model (ABM)](ABM.md). This page includes the link to my GitHub repository with the code to my ABM. This page also displays a GIF of my final ABM for you to see.
